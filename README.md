What is TRS? 

The Training Report System 
---------------------------

-   A web application, designed to retrieve data from submitted Jolt reports and process it to fulfill unique training tasks for my workplace. TRS runs twice a week and uses Google Sheets  as a "database" to store information related to these tasks. 

-   TRS can visualize the various skills team members know within a Skill Chart, and process requests for training or retraining on specific positions.  

-   Additionally, TRS automatically sends messages, via Slack, regarding details on recent training completed. It also has the ability to send an optional email to team members regarding their performance  and receive feedback for training sessions

What is the Skill Chart
=======================

-   A spreadsheet that visualizes what positions are known by what team members. If a team member knows a position, the appropriate cell will be color coded

Who can make requests?
----------------------

-   Only trainers, shift leads, and business leads can fill out a request form. However, any of these members are allowed to fill out a request on behalf of a team member.

-   Note: Not every training needs to be the result of a request, it exists solely for team members to easily reach the Training Coordinator.

-   Note: Requests that are 4 months old will be DELETED regardless of fulfillment status. This protocol exists for storage purposes. 

Who has access?
---------------

-   Viewing: All leads, all trainers

-   Editing: Me! Me! Me! And only me!

-   Security to ensure no one edits the column headers

-   Also to ensure no one is editing while TRS does a bi-weekly edit

Goals
=====

-   Provide structure for retraining

-   Provide Way to Visually Analyze BOH Skills

-   Automate Slack Messaging

-   Give team members & leads a platform to request training or retraining/reps

-   Provide team members with written feedback

-   optional report regarding team member's performance, feedback, advice, and pathways resources

Desired Benefits
================

-   The Skill Chart to be used as a reference for all leads

-   Case 1: Help leads position team members

-   New employees 

-   Positioning am workers at night

-   Positioning pm workers during morning

-   Case 2: Reflect on current skill-pool and use it to help request training or retraining

-   Case 3: Help with scheduling workers

-   Ultimately: Take some pressure off leads

-   Build a more versatile team 

-   Allow older team members to continuously have the opportunity to develop 

-   Allow leads to an easier way to provide input on how team members perform

-   If they believe they need more training, etc.

-   Allow old team members refresher sessions

-   Legitimize retraining as an avenue to educate on a position's nuisance 

-   Ultimately: Strengthen the training experience & Minimize the unequal distribution of skills (i.e. raw spray, prep)

-   Bonus: Minimize pressure off of leads who can focus more on running operations and  completing secondary tasks/cleaning. Focus less on micromanaging. Worry less about weak points in a setup by eliminating them.

Future Expansions
=================

-   Include Pathways Links for biscuits, eggs, bf-centerline, and prep

-   Reinforcement report

-   A jolt checklist for each position that'll be used to "grade" a team members knowledge of the station, 

-   Focuses more on the greater nuisance of a position, proper procedures, flexibility, speed, and accuracy 

-   Goal: Provide a clear rubric of what we'd want from an ideal worker

-   Add Specialized Cleaning skills into the skill chart

-   Visualize who knows how to do special cleaning cleaning tasks

-   I.e. Thaw Cabinets, Vector Ovens, Dishwasher, etc.

-   Assistant Desktop App 

-   Can create new Reinforcement Reports that follow proper Jolt setup

-   Can print an overview report of a team member, showing their ranking for each position 

Drawbacks & Anomalies
=====================

-   Slack messages and emails aren't sent instantaneously. When a report is completed, TRS will not run until Thursday or Sunday.

-   Alphabetical Sorting of the Skill Chart runs separately from the biweekly TRS processing, so that means when the Skill Chart updates it won't be sorted right away.

-   Currently unable to delete employees from the Skill Chart

-   Currently, unable to resend emails or send an email for a report that was submitted without an email or with a misspelled email

-   The coloring for the Skill Chart is a work in progress. It works, but it can't currently display certain colors. These colors include dark green and light green. Both of which will be available when Reinforcement Reports are introduced
